1.What is voltage?
-Potential energy (electric charge imbalance) capable of getting electrons to flow through a conductor. 
Technically measure of potential enrgy per unit charge of electrons. 
Expressed as quantity between two points.

2.What is resistance?
-Measure of opposition to electric current.
-They limit the amount of current through the circuit with given amount of voltage supplied by the battery,

3. Is a short circuit an example of a closed or open circuit?
-Closed. 

4.How can you determine if a cricuit is closed or open?
-Open circuits is when continuity has been broken by an interruption in the path for electrons to flow.
-Closed circuits is the opposite, where electrons can continuously flow through. 


5.Did you set up your computer to use the Feather?
